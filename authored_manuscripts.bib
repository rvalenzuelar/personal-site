	abstract = {Extreme rainfall events are thought to be one of the major threats of climate change given an increase of water vapor available in the atmosphere. However, before projecting future changes in extreme rainfall events, it is mandatory to know current patterns. In this study we explore extreme daily rainfall events along central-southern Chile with emphasis in their spatial distribution and concurrent synoptic-scale circulation. Surface rain gauges and reanalysis products from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis are employed to unravel the dependency between extreme rainfall and horizontal water vapor ﬂuxes. Results indicate that extreme rainfall events can occur everywhere, from the subtropical to extratropical latitudes, but their frequency increases where terrain has higher altitude, especially over the Andes Mountains. The majority of these events concentrate in austral winter, last a single day, and encompass a north–south band of about 200 km in length. Composited synoptic analyses identiﬁed extreme rainfall cases dominated by northwesterly ({NW}) and westerly (W) moisture ﬂuxes. Some features of the {NW} group include a 300-{hPa} trough projecting from the extratropics to subtropics, a surface-level depression, and cyclonic winds at 850 {hPa} along the coast associated with integrated water vapor ({IWV}) . 30 mm. Conversely, features in the W group include both a very weak 300-{hPa} trough and surface depression, as well as coastal westerly winds associated with {IWV} . 30 mm. About half of extreme daily rainfall is associated with an atmospheric river. Extreme rainfall observed in W ({NW}) cases has a strong orographic (synoptic) forcing. In addition, W cases are, on average, warmer than {NW} cases, leading to an ampliﬁed hydrological response.},

	abstract = {This study quantiﬁes the impact of atmospheric rivers ({ARs}) on precipitation in southern South America. An {AR} detection algorithm was developed based on integrated water vapor transport ({IVT}) from 6-hourly {CFSR} reanalysis data over a 16-yr period (2001–16). {AR} landfalls were linked to precipitation using a comprehensive observing network that spanned large variations in terrain along and across the Andes from 278 to 558S, including some sites with hourly data. Along the Paciﬁc (west) coast, {AR} landfalls are most frequent between 388 and 508S, averaging 35–40 days yr21. This decreases rapidly to the south and north of this maximum, as well as to the east of the Andes. Landfalling {ARs} are more frequent in winter/spring (summer/fall) to the north (south) of ;438S. {ARs} contribute 45\%–60\% of the annual precipitation in subtropical Chile (378–328S) and 40\%–55\% along the midlatitude west coast (378–478S). These values signiﬁcantly exceed those in western North America, likely due to the Andes being taller. In subtropical and midlatitude regions, roughly half of all events with top-quartile precipitation rates occur under {AR} conditions. Median daily and hourly precipitation in {ARs} is 2–3 times that of other storms. The results of this study extend knowledge of the key roles of {ARs} on precipitation, weather, and climate in the South American region. They enable comparisons with other areas globally, provide context for speciﬁc events, and support local nowcasting and forecasting.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              In late May 2019, at least seven tornadoes were reported within a 24-h period in southern Chile (western South America, 36°–38°S), including {EF}1 and {EF}2 events causing substantial damage to infrastructure, dozens of injuries, and one fatality. Despite anecdotal evidence and chronicles of similar historical events, the threat from tornadoes in Chile was regarded with skepticism until the 2019 outbreak. Herein, we describe the synoptic-scale features instrumental in the development of these tornadic storms, including an extended southwest–northeast trough along the South Pacific, with a large postfrontal instability area. Tornadic storms appear to be embedded in a modestly unstable environment (positive convective available potential energy but less than 1,000 J kg
              −1
              ) and strong low- and midlevel wind shear, with high near-surface storm-relative helicity values (close to −200 m
              2
              s
              −2
              ), clearly differing from the Great Plains tornadoes in North America (with highly unstable environments) but resembling cold-season tornadoes previously observed in the midlatitudes of North America, Australia, and Europe. Reanalyzing rainfall and lightning data from the last 10 years, we found that tornadic storms in our region occur associated with locally extreme values of both {CAPE} and low-level wind shear, where a combination of the two in a low-level vorticity generation parameter appears as a simple first-order discriminant between tornadic and nontornadic environments. Future research should thoroughly examine historical events worldwide to assemble a database of high-shear, low-{CAPE} midlatitude storms and help improve our understanding of these storms’ underlying physics.},

            This study documents the mean properties and variability of kinematic and precipitation structures associated with orographic precipitation along the coast of Northern California in the context of terrain-trapped airflows ({TTAs}). {TTAs} are defined as relatively narrow air masses that consistently flow in close proximity and approximately parallel to an orographic barrier. Seven land-falling winter storms are examined with observations from a scanning X-band Doppler radar deployed on the coast at Fort Ross, California. Additional information is provided by a 915-{MHz} wind-profiling radar, surface meteorology, a {GPS} receiver, and balloon soundings. The composite kinematic structure during {TTA} conditions exhibits a significant horizontal gradient of wind direction from the coast to approximately 50 km offshore and a low-level jet ({LLJ}) that surmounts a weaker airflow offshore corresponding to the {TTA}, with a zone of enhanced precipitation evident between {\textasciitilde}5 and 25 km offshore and oriented nearly parallel to the coastline. Conversely, the composite kinematic structure during {NO}-{TTA} conditions exhibits a smaller offshore horizontal gradient of wind direction and precipitation structures are generally enhanced within km of the coastline. Interstorm variability analysis reveals significant variations in kinematic structures during both {TTA} and {NO}-{TTA} conditions, whereas significant variations in precipitation structures are only evident during {TTA} conditions. The interstorm analysis also illustrates more clearly how {LLJ} vertical structures evident during {NO}-{TTA} conditions exhibit ascent along the coast and over the coastal mountains, which is in contrast to {TTA} conditions where the ascent occurs offshore and over the {TTA}.},

            The Chilean Coastal Orographic Precipitation Experiment ({CCOPE}) was conducted during the austral winter of 2015 (May–August) in the Nahuelbuta Mountains (peak elevation 1.3 km {MSL}) of southern Chile (38°S). {CCOPE} used soundings, two profiling Micro Rain Radars, a Parsivel disdrometer, and a rain gauge network to characterize warm and ice-initiated rain regimes and explore their consequences for orographic precipitation. Thirty-three percent of foothill rainfall fell during warm rain periods, while 50\% of rainfall fell during ice-initiated periods. Warm rain drop size distributions were characterized by many more and relatively smaller drops than ice-initiated drop size distributions. Both the portion and properties of warm and ice-initiated rainfall compare favorably with observations of coastal mountain rainfall at a similar latitude in California. Orographic enhancement is consistently strong for rain of both types, suggesting that seeding from ice aloft is not a requisite for large orographic enhancement. While the data suggest that orographic enhancement may be greater during warm rain regimes, the difference in orographic enhancement between regimes is not significant. Sounding launches indicate that differences in orographic enhancement are not easily explainable by differences in low-level moisture flux or nondimensional mountain height between the regimes.},

              This study develops an objective method of identifying terrain-trapped airflows ({TTAs}) along the coast of Northern California and documenting their impact on orographic rainfall. {TTAs} are defined as relatively narrow air masses that consistently flow in close proximity and approximately parallel to an orographic barrier. A 13-winter-seasons dataset is employed, including observations from a 915-{MHz} wind profiling radar along the coast at Bodega Bay ({BBY}, 15 m {MSL}) and surface meteorology stations at {BBY} and in the coastal mountains at Cazadero ({CZD}, 478 m {MSL}). A subset of rainy hours exhibits a profile with enhanced vertical shear and an easterly wind maximum in the lowest 500 m {MSL}, roughly the same depth as the nearby coastal terrain. Both flow features have a connection to {TTAs} along the coast of Northern California. Based on the average orientation (320°–140°) and altitude of nearby topography, mean wind direction in the lowest 500 m {MSL} (
              
                
              
              ) between 0°–140° is used as the initial criterion to identify {TTA} conditions. Application of this threshold yields a {CZD}/{BBY} rainfall ratio of 1.4 (3.2) for {TTA} ({NO} {TTA}) conditions. More detailed analysis of the relationship between
              
                
              
              and orographic rainfall reveals that an upper threshold of 150° more precisely divides the {TTA} and {NO}-{TTA} regimes. A sensitivity analysis and comparison with a {TTA} documented in a previous case study show that the best {TTA} identification criteria correspond to
              
                
              
              with a duration of at least 2 h. This objective identification method is applied to seven case studies in Part {II} of the present study.},

            This study documents orographic precipitation forcing along the coastal mountains of Northern California during the landfall of a significant winter storm over the period 16–18 February 2004. The primary observing asset is a scanning X-band Doppler radar deployed on the coast at Fort Ross, California, which provides low-level (e.g., below 1 km {MSL}) horizontal and vertical scans of radial velocity and reflectivity to characterize airflow and precipitation structures. Further context is provided by a wind-profiling radar, a radio acoustic sounding system ({RASS}), balloon soundings, buoys, a {GPS} receiver, and surface meteorological sensors. The winter storm is divided into two episodes, each having pre-cold-frontal low-level jet ({LLJ}) structures and atmospheric river characteristics. Episode 1 has a corridor of terrain-trapped airflow ({TTA}) that forms an interface with the {LLJ}. The interface extends {\textasciitilde}25 km offshore in a {\textasciitilde}0.5-km vertical layer, and the western edge of this interface near the ocean surface advances toward the coast over the course of {\textasciitilde}5 h. The {TTA} acts as a dynamically driven barrier, so that the incoming {LLJ} slopes upward offshore below 1.5 km {MSL} and precipitation is enhanced over the ocean and near the coast. The absence of a {TTA} in episode 2 allows the cross-barrier flow to slope upward and enhance precipitation directly over the coastal mountains. A theoretical analysis favors the hypothesis that a gap flow exiting the Petaluma Gap forces the {TTA}.},
