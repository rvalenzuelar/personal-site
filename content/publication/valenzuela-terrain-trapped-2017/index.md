abstract: Abstract  This study develops an objective method of identifying terrain-trapped
  airflows (TTAs) along the coast of Northern California and documenting their impact
  on orographic rainfall. TTAs are defined as relatively narrow air masses that consistently
  flow in close proximity and approximately parallel to an orographic barrier. A 13-winter-seasons
  dataset is employed, including observations from a 915-MHz wind profiling radar
  along the coast at Bodega Bay (BBY, 15 m MSL) and surface meteorology stations at
  BBY and in the coastal mountains at Cazadero (CZD, 478 m MSL). A subset of rainy
  hours exhibits a profile with enhanced vertical shear and an easterly wind maximum
  in the lowest 500 m MSL, roughly the same depth as the nearby coastal terrain. Both
  flow features have a connection to TTAs along the coast of Northern California.
  Based on the average orientation (320°–140°) and altitude of nearby topography,
  mean wind direction in the lowest 500 m MSL (    ) between 0°–140° is used as the
  initial criterion to identify TTA conditions. Application of this threshold yields
  a CZD/BBY rainfall ratio of 1.4 (3.2) for TTA (NO TTA) conditions. More detailed
  analysis of the relationship between    and orographic rainfall reveals that an
  upper threshold of 150° more precisely divides the TTA and NO-TTA regimes. A sensitivity
  analysis and comparison with a TTA documented in a previous case study show that
  the best TTA identification criteria correspond to    with a duration of at least
  2 h. This objective identification method is applied to seven case studies in Part
  II of the present study.
