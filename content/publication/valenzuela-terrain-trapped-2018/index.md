abstract: Abstract This study documents the mean properties and variability of kinematic
  and precipitation structures associated with orographic precipitation along the
  coast of Northern California in the context of terrain-trapped airflows (TTAs).
  TTAs are defined as relatively narrow air masses that consistently flow in close
  proximity and approximately parallel to an orographic barrier. Seven land-falling
  winter storms are examined with observations from a scanning X-band Doppler radar
  deployed on the coast at Fort Ross, California. Additional information is provided
  by a 915-MHz wind-profiling radar, surface meteorology, a GPS receiver, and balloon
  soundings. The composite kinematic structure during TTA conditions exhibits a significant
  horizontal gradient of wind direction from the coast to approximately 50 km offshore
  and a low-level jet (LLJ) that surmounts a weaker airflow offshore corresponding
  to the TTA, with a zone of enhanced precipitation evident between ~5 and 25 km offshore
  and oriented nearly parallel to the coastline. Conversely, the composite kinematic
  structure during NO-TTA conditions exhibits a smaller offshore horizontal gradient
  of wind direction and precipitation structures are generally enhanced within km
  of the coastline. Interstorm variability analysis reveals significant variations
  in kinematic structures during both TTA and NO-TTA conditions, whereas significant
  variations in precipitation structures are only evident during TTA conditions. The
  interstorm analysis also illustrates more clearly how LLJ vertical structures evident
  during NO-TTA conditions exhibit ascent along the coast and over the coastal mountains,
  which is in contrast to TTA conditions where the ascent occurs offshore and over
  the TTA.
