abstract: Extreme rainfall events are thought to be one of the major threats of climate
  change given an increase of water vapor available in the atmosphere. However, before
  projecting future changes in extreme rainfall events, it is mandatory to know current
  patterns. In this study we explore extreme daily rainfall events along central-southern
  Chile with emphasis in their spatial distribution and concurrent synoptic-scale
  circulation. Surface rain gauges and reanalysis products from the Climate Forecast
  System Reanalysis are employed to unravel the dependency between extreme rainfall
  and horizontal water vapor ﬂuxes. Results indicate that extreme rainfall events
  can occur everywhere, from the subtropical to extratropical latitudes, but their
  frequency increases where terrain has higher altitude, especially over the Andes
  Mountains. The majority of these events concentrate in austral winter, last a single
  day, and encompass a north–south band of about 200 km in length. Composited synoptic
  analyses identiﬁed extreme rainfall cases dominated by northwesterly (NW) and westerly
  (W) moisture ﬂuxes. Some features of the NW group include a 300-hPa trough projecting
  from the extratropics to subtropics, a surface-level depression, and cyclonic winds
  at 850 hPa along the coast associated with integrated water vapor (IWV) . 30 mm.
  Conversely, features in the W group include both a very weak 300-hPa trough and
  surface depression, as well as coastal westerly winds associated with IWV . 30 mm.
  About half of extreme daily rainfall is associated with an atmospheric river. Extreme
  rainfall observed in W (NW) cases has a strong orographic (synoptic) forcing. In
  addition, W cases are, on average, warmer than NW cases, leading to an ampliﬁed
  hydrological response.
