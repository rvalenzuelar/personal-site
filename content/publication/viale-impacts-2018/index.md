abstract: This study quantiﬁes the impact of atmospheric rivers (ARs) on precipitation
  in southern South America. An AR detection algorithm was developed based on integrated
  water vapor transport (IVT) from 6-hourly CFSR reanalysis data over a 16-yr period
  (2001–16). AR landfalls were linked to precipitation using a comprehensive observing
  network that spanned large variations in terrain along and across the Andes from
  278 to 558S, including some sites with hourly data. Along the Paciﬁc (west) coast,
  AR landfalls are most frequent between 388 and 508S, averaging 35–40 days yr21.
  This decreases rapidly to the south and north of this maximum, as well as to the
  east of the Andes. Landfalling ARs are more frequent in winter/spring (summer/fall)
  to the north (south) of ;438S. ARs contribute 45%–60% of the annual precipitation
  in subtropical Chile (378–328S) and 40%–55% along the midlatitude west coast (378–478S).
  These values signiﬁcantly exceed those in western North America, likely due to the
  Andes being taller. In subtropical and midlatitude regions, roughly half of all
  events with top-quartile precipitation rates occur under AR conditions. Median daily
  and hourly precipitation in ARs is 2–3 times that of other storms. The results of
  this study extend knowledge of the key roles of ARs on precipitation, weather, and
  climate in the South American region. They enable comparisons with other areas globally,
  provide context for speciﬁc events, and support local nowcasting and forecasting.
