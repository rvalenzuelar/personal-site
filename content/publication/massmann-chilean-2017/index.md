abstract: Abstract The Chilean Coastal Orographic Precipitation Experiment (CCOPE)
  was conducted during the austral winter of 2015 (May–August) in the Nahuelbuta Mountains
  (peak elevation 1.3 km MSL) of southern Chile (38°S). CCOPE used soundings, two
  profiling Micro Rain Radars, a Parsivel disdrometer, and a rain gauge network to
  characterize warm and ice-initiated rain regimes and explore their consequences
  for orographic precipitation. Thirty-three percent of foothill rainfall fell during
  warm rain periods, while 50% of rainfall fell during ice-initiated periods. Warm
  rain drop size distributions were characterized by many more and relatively smaller
  drops than ice-initiated drop size distributions. Both the portion and properties
  of warm and ice-initiated rainfall compare favorably with observations of coastal
  mountain rainfall at a similar latitude in California. Orographic enhancement is
  consistently strong for rain of both types, suggesting that seeding from ice aloft
  is not a requisite for large orographic enhancement. While the data suggest that
  orographic enhancement may be greater during warm rain regimes, the difference in
  orographic enhancement between regimes is not significant. Sounding launches indicate
  that differences in orographic enhancement are not easily explainable by differences
  in low-level moisture flux or nondimensional mountain height between the regimes.
