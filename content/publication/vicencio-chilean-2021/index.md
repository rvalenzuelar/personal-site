abstract: Abstract  In late May 2019, at least seven tornadoes were reported within
  a 24-h period in southern Chile (western South America, 36°–38°S), including EF1
  and EF2 events causing substantial damage to infrastructure, dozens of injuries,
  and one fatality. Despite anecdotal evidence and chronicles of similar historical
  events, the threat from tornadoes in Chile was regarded with skepticism until the
  2019 outbreak. Herein, we describe the synoptic-scale features instrumental in the
  development of these tornadic storms, including an extended southwest–northeast
  trough along the South Pacific, with a large postfrontal instability area. Tornadic
  storms appear to be embedded in a modestly unstable environment (positive convective
  available potential energy but less than 1,000 J kg −1 ) and strong low- and midlevel
  wind shear, with high near-surface storm-relative helicity values (close to −200
  m 2 s −2 ), clearly differing from the Great Plains tornadoes in North America (with
  highly unstable environments) but resembling cold-season tornadoes previously observed
  in the midlatitudes of North America, Australia, and Europe. Reanalyzing rainfall
  and lightning data from the last 10 years, we found that tornadic storms in our
  region occur associated with locally extreme values of both CAPE and low-level wind
  shear, where a combination of the two in a low-level vorticity generation parameter
  appears as a simple first-order discriminant between tornadic and nontornadic environments.
  Future research should thoroughly examine historical events worldwide to assemble
  a database of high-shear, low-CAPE midlatitude storms and help improve our understanding
  of these storms’ underlying physics.
