abstract: Abstract This study documents orographic precipitation forcing along the
  coastal mountains of Northern California during the landfall of a significant winter
  storm over the period 16â€“18 February 2004. The primary observing asset is a scanning
  X-band Doppler radar deployed on the coast at Fort Ross, California, which provides
  low-level (e.g., below 1 km MSL) horizontal and vertical scans of radial velocity
  and reflectivity to characterize airflow and precipitation structures. Further context
  is provided by a wind-profiling radar, a radio acoustic sounding system (RASS),
  balloon soundings, buoys, a GPS receiver, and surface meteorological sensors. The
  winter storm is divided into two episodes, each having pre-cold-frontal low-level
  jet (LLJ) structures and atmospheric river characteristics. Episode 1 has a corridor
  of terrain-trapped airflow (TTA) that forms an interface with the LLJ. The interface
  extends ~25 km offshore in a ~0.5-km vertical layer, and the western edge of this
  interface near the ocean surface advances toward the coast over the course of ~5
  h. The TTA acts as a dynamically driven barrier, so that the incoming LLJ slopes
  upward offshore below 1.5 km MSL and precipitation is enhanced over the ocean and
  near the coast. The absence of a TTA in episode 2 allows the cross-barrier flow
  to slope upward and enhance precipitation directly over the coastal mountains. A
  theoretical analysis favors the hypothesis that a gap flow exiting the Petaluma
  Gap forces the TTA.
