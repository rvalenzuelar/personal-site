The myriad of weather and climate data available today makes even more necessary to find the best way to display the information in a meaningful way so that the communication is effective. This project explore different approaches to create visualizations from weather and climate data.

On going initiatives include:
* Monitoring weather data from UOH meteorological station ([UOHmet](http://met.uoh.cl))
* Monitoring disdrometer data at ARO in Universidad de Concepci√≥n ([visor-parsivel](https://visor-parsivel.herokuapp.com/))
* Display rainfall data in a cyclical way ([Sala de Lluvias](http://saladelluvias.uoh.cl/))
* Building 3D visualizations with Paraview

Future ideas to be addressed by UOH students include:
* Improve monitoring data of UOHmet
* Create interactive visualization for UOHmet
* Animate 3D or 4D data from ERA5 reanalysis in Paraview
* Explore new and creative ways to visualize weather and climate data
