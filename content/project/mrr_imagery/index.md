This gallery displays images captured with a Micro Rain Radar installed at the roof of Universidad de O'Higgins in Rancagua, Chile. The original MRR processing script and the reflectivity colormap were developed by [Adam Massmann](https://massma.github.io). All current scripts are written in Python by Ra√∫l Valenzuela using Proplot and Xarray. Raw data is converted to netCDF format using Peter Kuma's [mrr2c](https://github.com/peterkuma/mrr2c). This project is funded by grant ANID Fondecyt Iniciacion 11230184.
