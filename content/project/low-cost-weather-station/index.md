Weather stations are a key component of the atmospheric monitoring. One limitation to deploy dense networks is the cost of a professional station. This cost is often associated to the datalogger, which needs to be roboust when deploying in isolated and difficult-access locations. However, when thinking in easy-access locations and having a power line nearby, low-cost stations are a viable alternative.

In this project we aim to build a low-cost but realiable weather station based on open-source electronic components. The first step was made by Anibal Cerda, former UOH Electrical Civil Engineer student that designed and built a first version of the low-cost weather station ([PDF](/uploads/acerda_uoh_thesis.pdf) in spanish).

Future steps to be addressed by UOH students include:
* Design and build a PCB board to remove cables
* Experiment with wireless communication (WiFi, LoRa)
* Test solar and wind energy battery charging
